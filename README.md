# the_artivist_stripe_payment

This project contains a serverless Lambda function designed to handle payment processing through Stripe. The function, `the_artivist_stripe_payment`, is deployed on Vercel and can be used to create payment intents, process charges, manage subscriptions, and perform other payment-related tasks.

## What This Project Does

The `the_artivist_stripe_payment` Lambda function acts as a backend service that communicates with Stripe's payment processing API. It securely handles requests to create payment intents and provides the necessary client secrets for frontend integration, ensuring a smooth payment experience.

## Local Development

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project with the following content:
   ```env
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the local development environment powered by Vercel, which simulates the Vercel deployment.

5. Access the function:
   The function will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api/the_artivist_stripe_payment` for local testing and development.

## Deploying to Vercel

To deploy the function to Vercel, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Set up your Vercel project:
   - Log in to your Vercel account and create a new project.
   - Connect your GitHub repository to the Vercel project.

2. Configure environment variables on Vercel:
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel.
   - Add the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable.

3. Deploy the function:
   - Push your changes to the connected repository branch.
   - Vercel automatically deploys your project upon push to the connected repository, given that the push is made to a branch that Vercel is tracking (usually the main or master branch).

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying, you can test the live function by making POST requests to the endpoint provided by Vercel, which will be something like `https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/api/the_artivist_stripe_payment`.

Ensure to use the appropriate request body and headers, as expected by the Stripe API and your Lambda function's implementation.

## Security Considerations

- Never expose your `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` or any sensitive keys in the frontend code.
- Validate request body and implement proper error handling to prevent misuse of the API.
- Consider implementing authentication to restrict access to the function endpoint.

For more information on Stripe's API and security practices, refer to the [Stripe API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api).

Lembre-se de substituir `<repository-url>` e `<repository-name>` pelas informações reais do seu projeto, e `your_stripe_secret_key` pela sua chave secreta do Stripe. Este README dá uma visão geral do que o projeto faz, como executá-lo localmente e como fazer o deploy no Vercel. Ele também destaca algumas considerações de segurança importantes.
